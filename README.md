** Detecting Malaria cells using Convolutional Neural Network **

** Overview **

The data is collected from an authorized portal and the main objective is to design and develop a neural network model for future malaria prediction. The dataset contains 27558 images categorized into two folders. The parasitized folder contains images of malaria infected cells and uninfected folder contains images of clear blood cells.
